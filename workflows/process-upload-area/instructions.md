# Process Upload Area - Instructions

<critical>This workflow processes all documents in the upload area using the Document Classifier agent</critical>
<critical>Hybrid classification: Rules first, then AI for ambiguous cases</critical>
<critical>Auto-move if confidence >90%, suggest if 70-90%, manual review if <70%</critical>

<workflow>

<step n="1" goal="Initialize and check upload area">
<action>Greet {user_name} and explain the process:

"I'll process all documents in your upload area using intelligent classification.

**How it works:**
1. Scan upload folder for new documents
2. Analyze each document (including ZIP extraction, OCR for images)
3. Match to IRL requirements (if IRL exists)
4. Classify with confidence scoring
5. Auto-move high-confidence matches (>90%)
6. Flag medium/low confidence for your review

**Files will be preserved** - originals archived, never lost."
</action>

<action>Check upload folder structure:

**Expected structure:**
```
{upload_path}/
├── pending/        # Drop new files here
├── processed/      # Successfully classified (archived)
├── review/         # Needs manual review
└── failed/         # Processing errors
```

**Note:** Upload area is created automatically at deal startup, so folders should already exist.
If any subfolders are missing, create them automatically (this handles legacy or corrupted setups).
</action>

<action>Scan for uploaded files:

**Scan:** {upload_path}/pending/

**Count:**
- Total files
- By type (PDF, Excel, Word, ZIP, Images, etc.)
- Total size

**Report findings:**
"📂 **Upload Area Status**

**Pending files:** {count}
- PDFs: {pdf_count}
- Excel: {excel_count}
- Word: {word_count}
- PowerPoint: {ppt_count}
- Images: {img_count}
- ZIP archives: {zip_count}

**Total size:** {size} MB

Ready to process?"

<action if="no-files">
"No files found in upload/pending/ folder.

**To upload documents:**
1. Place files in: {upload_path}/pending/
2. Run this workflow again

Or drop files now and I'll wait..."
</action>
</step>

<step n="2" goal="Load IRL checklist if available">
<action>Check for IRL:

**Load:** {irl_checklist_path}

If IRL exists:
- Parse all categories and requirements
- Note priorities (High/Medium/Low)
- Prepare IRL matching engine
- "✅ IRL checklist loaded - will prioritize IRL requirements"

If no IRL:
- Use standard M&A classification
- "ℹ️ No IRL found - using standard M&A categories"
</action>
</step>

<step n="3" goal="Pre-process special file types">
<action>Handle ZIP files first:

**For each ZIP file:**
1. Extract to temporary location
2. Preserve any meaningful folder structure
3. Add extracted files to processing queue
4. Move original ZIP to processed/ with metadata
5. Log extraction: "{zip_name} → {count} files extracted"

**Report:**
"📦 **ZIP Processing**
- {zip_count} ZIP files found
- {total_extracted} files extracted
- Ready for classification"
</action>

<action>Prepare images for OCR:

**For each image file (.jpg, .png, .tiff):**
1. Check if scanned document (vs photo)
2. Pre-process for OCR (contrast, orientation)
3. Flag for OCR processing
4. "📸 {img_count} images prepared for OCR"
</action>
</step>

<step n="4" goal="Batch document classification">
<action>Process documents in batches (50 at a time):

**For each document, invoke Document Classifier agent:**

**Phase 1: Quick Analysis (Metadata & Filename)**
- Extract filename patterns
- Parse dates, versions, quality indicators
- Quick rule-based classification
- Initial confidence score

**Phase 2: Content Analysis**
- Extract text (OCR if needed)
- Identify document type signatures
- Extract key entities (amounts, dates, names)
- Keyword matching

**Phase 3: IRL Matching** (if IRL exists)
- Match against IRL requirements
- Check if document satisfies specific IRL items
- Boost confidence if strong IRL match
- Note priority level

**Phase 4: AI Classification** (if confidence < 90%)
- LLM analyzes document content
- Provides classification reasoning
- Final confidence score

**Classification Result:**
```yaml
document: "ACME-2023-Audited-Financials.pdf"
analysis:
  filename_match: "audited financial"
  content_keywords: ["audit opinion", "KPMG", "consolidated balance sheet"]
  doc_type: "Audited Financial Statements"

</step>

<step n="5" goal="Execute classification decisions">
<action>For HIGH CONFIDENCE classifications (>90%):

**Auto-move documents:**
1. Check if target folder exists
2. If not, create with proper naming
3. Check for duplicates
4. Move file to target location
5. Log action
6. If IRL match, update IRL status

**Report:**
"✅ **Auto-Classified ({count} documents)**

| Articles-Inc.pdf | Legal | corporate/ | 98% |

**IRL Items Completed:**
✅ Audited Financial Statements (High Priority)
✅ Customer List (High Priority)"
</action>

<action>For MEDIUM CONFIDENCE classifications (70-90%):

**Stage for review:**
1. Move to review/ folder
2. Create suggestion file with metadata
3. Prepare for user review in next step

**Example suggestion:**
```yaml
document: "misc-financial-report.pdf"
confidence: 0.82
suggested_category: "Financial Information"
suggested_folder: "1-financial-information/management-accounts"
reasoning: "Contains monthly financial data, appears to be management accounts"
irl_match: "Management Accounts (High Priority)"
alternatives:
  - category: "Financial Information"
    folder: "forecasts-budgets"
    confidence: 0.68
```
</action>

<action>For LOW CONFIDENCE classifications (<70%):

**Flag for manual review:**
1. Move to review/ folder
2. Note low confidence
3. Extract what information is available
4. Prepare for manual classification

**Example:**
```yaml
document: "unknown-document.pdf"
confidence: 0.45
issue: "Document content ambiguous"
extracted_info:
  - Contains tables and charts
  - Date: Q3 2024
  - Low text content
