# Investment Storyline Workshop - Execution Instructions

## Overview

This workflow facilitates an **interactive storyline development session** with the user to create a compelling investment narrative for CIM creation. The workflow follows a **5-Act structure** (Discovery → Synthesis → Construction → Validation → Documentation) and emphasizes **story-first, slides-second** philosophy.

## Primary Agent

**Story Architect** leads this workflow, coordinating with:
- **Information Vault** - for data retrieval and fact verification
- **Finance Analyst** - for financial insights and value drivers
- **Company Analyst** - for business strengths and competitive positioning

## Workflow Philosophy

**Story Before Slides**: Develop the narrative in prose form before thinking about PowerPoint. A coherent story translates into great slides; great slides without a story create confusion.

**Collaborative, Not Dictated**: The Story Architect facilitates dialogue with the user. The user knows the business; the agent structures that knowledge into a compelling narrative.

**Evidence-Based**: Every claim must link to supporting data from the Information Vault. No hand-waving or unsubstantiated statements.

**Buyer-Focused**: The storyline must resonate with the target buyer type and address their key priorities.

---

### **ACT 3: CONSTRUCTION** (Building the Narrative)

**Objective:** Construct the full investment storyline with narrative arc

**Steps:**

1. **Investment Thesis Statement**
   - Draft investment thesis using Opportunity-Value-Potential-Proof-Fit framework
   - Present to user:
     ```
     **Draft Investment Thesis:**

     [Company Name] is a [market position] [business type] serving [target market].

     **The Opportunity:** [What is this company?]
     **The Value:** [Why is it valuable - performance and positioning]
     **The Potential:** [What could it become - growth opportunities]
     **The Proof:** [Why should buyers believe it - evidence]
     **Ideal Buyer Profile:** [Who should buy and why]
     ```
   - Refine based on user feedback

2. **Narrative Arc Development**
   - Structure the story flow:
     - **Opening (The Opportunity)**: How we introduce the company and grab attention
     - **Rising Action (The Business)**: What they do, how they do it, why customers buy
     - **Climax (The Value Creation)**: Performance to date and future potential
     - **Resolution (The Investment)**: Why this is attractive, who should buy, what's next

3. **Message Hierarchy**
   - Develop 4-level message structure:
     - **Level 1 (Headline)**: The one thing buyers remember
     - **Level 2 (Pillars)**: 3-5 core themes
     - **Level 3 (Evidence)**: Key facts supporting each pillar
     - **Level 4 (Details)**: Supporting context for deep divers

4. **Evidence Mapping**
   - For each claim in the storyline, map to source:
     - Request verification from Information Vault
     - "Information Vault: Verify [claim] and provide source citation"
   - Create evidence map showing claim → source linkages
   - Flag any claims lacking supporting data

5. **Risk Acknowledgment**
   - Identify potential buyer concerns
   - Develop how to address in narrative (acknowledge + mitigate)
   - Examples:
     - Customer concentration → "Yes, but retention is 95% and diversification underway"
     - Management depth → "Experienced leadership + succession planning in place"

**Output from Act 3:**
- Complete investment thesis statement
- Structured narrative arc
- Message hierarchy (headline → pillars → evidence → details)
- Evidence map linking claims to sources
- Risk mitigation strategy

### **ACT 4: VALIDATION** (Testing the Story)

**Objective:** Ensure storyline is coherent, compelling, and buyer-relevant

**Steps:**

1. **Coherence Check**
   - Review narrative flow: Does opening lead logically to resolution?
   - Check theme consistency: Do all pieces support the same story?
   - Validate evidence: Is every claim backed by data?

2. **Buyer Persona Test**
   - Review storyline through lens of target buyer type:
     - **Strategic Buyers**: Does it show synergy potential and strategic fit?
     - **Financial Buyers**: Does it show growth runway and cash flow potential?
     - **International Buyers**: Does it show market entry advantage?
     - **Competitors**: Does it show consolidation value?
   - Ask user: "If you were a [target buyer type], would this resonate?"

3. **Clarity and Simplicity Check**
   - Is the storyline clear and easy to understand?
   - Have we avoided jargon and overcomplexity?
   - Can someone explain this company in 60 seconds using our storyline?

4. **Gap Identification**
   - What claims lack strong evidence?
   - What questions might buyers ask that we haven't addressed?
   - What additional data would strengthen the storyline?

5. **User Confirmation**
   - Present complete storyline for final review
   - Ask: "Does this storyline feel right?"
   - Ask: "Is this how you want buyers to think about this company?"
   - Make final refinements

**Output from Act 4:**
- Validated storyline that passes coherence, buyer relevance, and clarity tests
- Identified gaps for future data collection
- User confirmation and buy-in

## Special Handling

### If Data is Limited

If the data room has insufficient data for robust storyline:
1. Use Act 1 Discovery to gather user knowledge
2. Flag data gaps clearly in Act 2 Synthesis
3. Build storyline with available data + user input
4. Mark claims as "User-Provided (Pending Verification)" in evidence map
5. Recommend running data room audit workflow
6. Suggest specific documents to request from company

### If User Disagrees with Themes

If user pushes back on proposed themes:
- Ask probing questions: "What would you emphasize instead?"
- Request user to propose alternative themes
- Validate user themes against available data
- If data doesn't support user theme, discuss gap transparently
- Remember: User knows business, agent structures knowledge

### If Inconsistencies Found

If Finance Analyst or Information Vault flag inconsistencies during storyline development:
1. Immediately surface to user
2. Don't include contradictory claims in storyline
3. Investigate which source is correct
4. If unresolved, acknowledge in risk section or exclude entirely

---

## Configuration Usage

Access these values from install-config.yaml:
- `data_room_path` - for data availability context
- `output_location` - for saving deliverables
- `template_preference` - for formatting outputs
- `inconsistency_sensitivity` - for claim validation rigor

---

## Best Practices

1. **Listen More Than Tell**: User input is critical. Facilitate, don't dictate.

2. **Show Your Work**: Always show supporting evidence for proposed themes.

3. **Iterate**: Expect 2-3 rounds of refinement on themes and thesis.

4. **Validate Early**: Test buyer relevance in Act 2, not after full construction.

5. **Evidence First**: Never construct narrative before gathering data from agents.

6. **Save Frequently**: Save storyline brief after each act in case of interruption.

7. **Be Honest About Gaps**: Better to acknowledge missing data than fake it.

8. **Stay Focused**: If workshop gets derailed, bring back to core question: "What's the investment story?"
