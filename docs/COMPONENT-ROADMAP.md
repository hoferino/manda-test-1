- **Value:** Internal approval process

#### RAG Implementation

**Status:** Designed (not implemented)
**Priority:** High for production use
**Effort:** 40-60 hours (engineering work)

The Information Vault has a complete RAG architecture design but requires implementation:

- [ ] Set up vector database (Pinecone, Weaviate, or ChromaDB)
- [ ] Implement document parser (PDF, Excel, Word, PPT)
- [ ] Build intelligent chunking engine
- [ ] Deploy embedding model
- [ ] Create hybrid search (vector + keyword)
- [ ] Implement cross-encoder reranking
- [ ] Build context assembly logic
- [ ] Set up structured database (PostgreSQL/DuckDB)
- [ ] Create metadata catalog
- [ ] Implement source tracking and provenance
- [ ] Build inconsistency detection engine
- [ ] Add caching layer for performance
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging

**Reference:** See `agents/information-vault-rag-implementation.md` for complete technical specification.

**Note:** For MVP testing, the Information Vault can operate in "simulation mode" where queries are handled conversationally until RAG implementation is complete.
